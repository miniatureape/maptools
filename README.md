# Maptools

A tool for doing advance research of a place.

## TODOS

- Start on the UI
    - List of places if any.
    - A button to set one as "Home"
    - There is a button to set your prefered travel time?
    - There is a button that exposes the UI.
- Add place selection to map:
    - Create a new component that represents the info window.
        - It should say the place name.
        - If there is a home set, it should fetch travel times and display them there.
        - There should be a button to save it to your places
    - If you select a place, we show a UI to save it.
